Slovenia without waste is not an illusion
In the past few years, Slovenians managed to recycle 55% of their municipal solid waste, some
communities even up to 80%, which made Slovenia the best performing country in the European
Union. Some local communities in Europe recycle and compost over 90% of their waste - or very close
to zero. Such incentives are becoming a part of EU development strategies, which set the goal of a
totally recycling society, a circular economy and the efficient use of natural resources. With our help,
first Slovenian municipalities decided to follow the path towards Zero Waste, among them Ljubljana as
the first European capital.


Our vision: the world without waste
In a society without waste, landfills and incinerators will become unnecessary because by using eco
design producers will make sure that we’ll be able to separately collect all materials in waste and
return them to technological or natural cycles without any risks. New forms of services will develop,
such as product leasing and repair, together with responsible consumption.

Our mission: together we can move frontiers faster
Every train is made of a set of wagons, but they need an engine to pull them to their destination. From
our ‘Let’s Cleanup Slovenia’ campaigns we learned that the most effective drive for a change is a
movement which starts with connecting a large number of individuals. Connecting is done by engine
which leads the movement to their common goal.
Our mission is activation, motivation and cooperation of individuals, communities, policy makers,
industry, businesses and researchers in the area of an efficient use of natural resources with the aim to
reduce costs, preserve energy and create new green jobs. We educate and build opportunities for waste
prevention, separate collection, recycling and composting of materials in waste.

Zero Waste Slovenia
In February 2014 we became a national organization of Zero Waste Europe network. We started to
promote the concept, set up the web page and organized visits to best practices in Europe for Slovenian
waste management companies. In September 2014, first 4 municipalities joined the network of
communities on the road to Zero Waste, including Ljubljana as the first European capital. By the end of
2014 two more municipalities joined the network and several others expressed their intention to follow.
Our aim is to adopt Zero Waste strategy on the national level.

Tekstilnica saves waste textiles
Up until recently, separate collection of waste textiles was the exception rather than the rule, and it
mainly ended up on landfills or in incinerators. Together with the social venture Zadruga Dobrote, we
collect, recover and occasionally sell or donate waste textiles, altogether creating 6 new green jobs.
Over 550 tons have been diverted from landfills, additional tons of clothing have been exchanged at
our regular monthly exchanges. Textile containers became a part of curbside collection, and wearing
second hand clothes is no longer a prejudice.

Paper waste for new hope
We carried out three campaigns of collecting waste paper together with school children, businesses
and other institutions. Campaigns are intended as awareness-raising about why separate collection
and recycling are important, and to show that secondary materials do have value. A part of the raised
funds from selling collected paper was donated for charitable causes: we helped build a house for an
underprivileged family, an educational centre for children in Malawi was built, and lunch for children in
elementary schools co-financed.

Slovenia without food waste
The European Union estimates that over 179,000 tons of food waste are generated in Slovenia alone,
the majority of which is kitchen waste. Food waste is generated along the entire food supply chain.
By building the national platform ‘Slovenia without food waste’, we’d like to connect fragmented and
unconnected stakeholders from the farms to stores. They will commit to a common goal: to reduce the
amounts of food waste.

Healthy kids in cloth diapers
A single child produces 874 kg of waste single use nappies, which in Slovenia means around 20,000
ton of waste or 2 million Euros of costs for landfilling. This is why we proposed the use of cloth nappies
to the Vrtec Vrhnika kindergarten, where 220 children have been wearing them since September
2014. We promote their use, aiming at dissolving the myths about cloth nappies. We organize meetings
with parents where they can share their experiences, get the information about cloth nappies and find
answers to their questions.

Plastic bag? No, thank you!
Each citizen of Slovenia uses around 150 plastic bags each year. After 30 minutes of their use, most of
them end up in mixed waste. A number of countries already accepted measures to decrease the use of
plastic bags. In 2010, we passed a bill proposal to the national parliament, but after the strong opposition
of plastic industry, the bill didn’t pass the procedure. Nevertheless, a majority of stores removed free
plastic bags. The European Commission and the European Parliament proposed to reduce the use of
plastic bags by 80% by 2019. We will continue with our campaigns to reach this goal.

We share our knowledge
We helped establish ‘Let’s do it Mediterranean’ campaigns and also carried them out in Slovenia. The
entire campaign connected 15 countries in the region, with over 60,000 volunteers. We are a member
of the global ‘Let’s do it!’ movement of 112 countries.
We participated in the process of adoption legislation and programs on European, national and local
levels. Several students gained skills and experiences working or volunteering for our association. We
carried out 43 lectures about environmental issues, and worked with children of different ages at 15
workshops.

Together we can move frontiers faster: you can add your wagon
“Because we are trashing our planet and it’s time to stop.” - Jeremy Irons in Trashed

Ecologists Without Borders believe in transforming piles of useless trash to resources for our economycreating new, local jobs, and at the same time making sure we pass healthy environment to ouchildren. This is a doable goal, which has already been proven by many individuals, businesses and
local communities on a global level that decided to follow the Zero Waste way.
To reach this aim, we need two things: to believe that this is possible, and your support which wilmake sure the engine and the wagons reach their destination.
We invite you to join our fundraising campaign. We’ll be happy to present further donation or sponsorship
possibilities if you send us an e-mail: info@ocistimo.si
You can donate directly to our account. In case you need a donation agreement, you can find it here.
